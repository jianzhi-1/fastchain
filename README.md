# SYPT 2017: Fast Chain
This git repository consists of my codes and theory for solving Fast Chain. The project was done between Dec 2016 and Jan 2017.

### Problem Statement
<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="https://github.com/jianzhi-1/fastchain/blob/master/fastchain.png">
6. Fast chain
A chain consisting of wooden blocks inclined relative to the vertical and connected by two threads (see Figure) is suspended vertically and then released. 
Compared to free fall, the chain falls faster when it is dropped onto a horizontal surface. 
Explain this phenomenon and investigate how the relevant parameters affect the motion.

### Challenges faced and future recommendations
There are two main challenges with regards to the experiment. It is difficult to drop the chain 
in a way such that all the strings are initially straight but are not tense. A way to overcome this 
will be to have magnetic rods which are held at specific positions in an electromagnetic field such that the 
conditions are fulfilled. However, that may be an overkill for a mechanical experiment.

Another challenge is the small time between subsequent falls of rods. This is worsened by the fact that the inconsistency 
of tracking programs may cause fluctuations in y position of rods, and subsequently y dot values. Hence 
the experiment may not adequately justify the theory. A way to walk around this would be to conduct the experiment 
in a viscous liquid, where time intervals between subsequent collisions of rods is longer, leading to a more accurate y dot 
graph.
